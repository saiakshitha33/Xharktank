# XharkTank
XharkTank is a panel of potential investors, termed as "Sharks", who listen to entrepreneurs pitch ideas for a business or product they wish to develop.These self-made multi-millionaires judge the business concepts and products pitched and then decide whether to invest their own money to help market and mentor each contestant.

This XharkTank project provides a platform where budding entrepreneurs can pitch ideas for a business or product they wish to develop by providing their ***name, title & idea for the business, investment amount*** they expect to be fulfilled and the ***percentage of equity*** they are ready to shed away to the potential investors.
